# Text to quack

## This Rust program in the terminal turns the text you input into quacks in 2 preselected formats:

#### If translation to discord

*TEXT IN QUACKS* 

-# Translation: *ORIGINAL TEXT*

**Translation = 1 is intended to be used in Discord.**

#### If translation to none

*TEXT IN QUACKS*

#### If translation to plain

*TEXT IN QUACKS*
*ORIGINAL TEXT*

### COPY THE OUPUT FROM THE TERMINAL 

## This project is currently still WIP and new things are going to be added soon:

Use of enigo to paste the quacks for you after certain seconds
