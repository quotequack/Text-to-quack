# Text to quack

## This Rust program in the terminal turns the text you input into quacks in 2 preselected formats:

#### If translation = 1

*TEXT IN QUACKS* 

-# Translation: *ORIGINAL TEXT*

#### If translation = 0

*TEXT IN QUACKS*

**Translation = 1 is intended to be used in Discord or any other markdown programs. Have fun!**

## This project is currently still WIP and new things are going to be added soon:
GUI elements

Looping Quack translations
